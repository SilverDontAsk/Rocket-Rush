# Description

The game consists of 1 or 2 players dodging asteroids and rockets while attempting to survive as long as possible in a space-themed environment. Players win by being the one to survive the longest. 

Our game uses the typical WASD to move but on versus mode it requires the arrow keys for second player to move. So things like 60% keyboards will not work for this game.
