What progress we faced off...

As a team, we encountered several challenges while working on this project.
The first of these was communication within the teamâ€”deciding who would handle what aspects of the project and how to maintain effective communication while working.

After overcoming that obstacle, we faced Godot, an engine developed for creating video games that offers a wide variety of techniques to enable us to accomplish everything in a single app.
The challenge was to learn how to use it effectively within the timeframe we had to develop the project, especially since none of us had prior experience with it.

In the game creation process, I found that the most difficult part was implementing the scoring system within the game.
Ensuring that the game saved the highest score was quite challenging, but with much effort and patience, we overcame this obstacle.

We still have one final challenge ahead of us: completing the versus mode to make it as playable as the single-player mode.
However, we are close to the finish line, and soon everyone will be able to enjoy the game just like we do.
