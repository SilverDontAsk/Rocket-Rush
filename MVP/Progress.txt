Progress:

In a scale of 1 to 10, our progress right now is a 8 out of 10.
We have made significant strides in our project, particularly in refining the single-player mode and establishing the foundation for the versus mode.

Explanation of progress assessment:

We focused primarily on enhancing the single-player experience. We successfully implemented the core gameplay mechanics, including player movement, enemy spawning, and a scoring system.
We also completed the user interface elements, allowing players to track their score and damage effectively.

In addition, we created a settings menu where players can adjust game options, which added an extra layer of polish to the game.
The game is now more enjoyable and engaging, thanks to these improvements.

Completed parts of the project as planned:

1 - Fully functional single-player mode with scoring and damage tracking.
2 - User interface implemented, displaying current score and damage.
3 -  Settings menu created for player customization.
4 - Initial testing of gameplay mechanics and balancing.

Incomplete aspects of the project:

1 - Versus mode is still under development and needs to be completed to ensure a balanced multiplayer experience.
2 - Final testing and debugging of the single-player mode and UI.
3 - Additional polish and visual enhancements to the game assets.
